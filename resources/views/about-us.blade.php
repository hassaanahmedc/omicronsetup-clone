            <p class="my-7 text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Well then. Without going into some
                philosophical crap, I can try to
                describe myself. I'm a student at [ARBITRARY UNIVERSITY] at
                faculty
                of [ARBITRARY CS FACULTY]. I got cursed with speech disorder
                that
                makes me stutter. It made me quite shy (altought that may be
                excuse,
                more then a reason), but being around reasonable people makes me
                semi-reasonable myself. I try to live by a certain saying:
                Everytime
                you meet someone, judge them. Everytime someone does something
                wrong, say it to them. But everytime you discover something
                about
                yourself, keep it to yourself. If you share something about
                yourself, make absolutely sure that it's true and that it will
                remain true. I know people tend to change, but they also tend to
                belive that others will not. But I'm not some wise man, I'm just
                sharing what I learned from my fragile social interactions.
                Still
                got into philosophical crap...ah well. </p>

            </h3>
            <p class="my-7 text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">I really like to tweak around with
                Linux systems, write small programs, and a bit of math on top of
                that. Proof of this is the fact that I'm writing this on vim
                neovim on my majestic Thinkpad X200/X1 Carbon with Slackware
                14.2 Debian/Fedora installed on it. I should really stop
                distro-hopping. Other than that, I have a few amateur-ish
                projects written mostly in C, C++ and some other languages such
                as PHP, JavaScript and Python. I tried to write in C# at one
                point (due to a possible job opportunity), but it got me
                horrifed and I realized it's not for me...the language as well
                as the job. Also, as a member of a DevOps team, I started to
                work with Ansible. I find it quite amazing. I'm not a huge fan
                of all the Python monopoly, but this project really hits the
                spot with server deployment. Docker is also nice, altought it's
                learning curve is more like a wall then a curve. As you can see,
                my web dev abilities are very limited (please no looking at
                source), even though I enjoyed writing this page.</p>

            <h3 class="my-7 text-xl font-bold text-lightMd-title_txt dark:text-darkMd-title_txt">What do I like?
            </h3>
            <p class="my-7 text-lg font-bold dark:text-white">Well, ofcourse I like all my
                friends as they constantly keep up with my crap and because they
                allow me to keep up with their crap. Enjoying a time with
                friends over some video game can be very enjoyable, but nothing
                beats meeting up and having a blast together. (#COVIDHATE) And
                surely I love to code something, while listening to latest music
                my mind desires. What genre you ask? Only god would know. It
                ranges from Shoegaze through Lo-fi to Metal. But I'm no alien,
                so a nice book, rainy weather, some warm beverage and a cat on
                my lap will always make my day better. As for my hobbies, lately
                I've been getting interested in stars and universe in general.
                It's amazing how big and wonderfull the universe can be, and how
                tiny and insignificant we are. Some may call it a passion. I'm
                not so sure about it yet, but we'll see where it goes. Oh yea,
                and for the more cultured of you...I love Lain </p>
